# Group Project - Walkable Edinburgh

Project completed as part of CodeClan 16 week intensive Software Development bootcamp.

This app allows users to plan a route through pre-curated tourist attractions in Edinburgh.

Built using JavaScript, MongoDB, HTML and CSS.

## Brief

Visit Scotland are look for ways to encourage people to walk and cycle. Your task is to create an app that allows users to search for cycling and hiking routes, view routes on a map, save routes to a wishlist and mark a route done.

You could use GoogleMaps Directions API:

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/

MVP

Users should be able to:
Select start and finish locations for their route
Save routes to a wishlist
Mark completed routes as ‘done’

## Extra Features
* App displays current weather from [Dark Ski API](https://darksky.net/dev)
* When a map info window is clicked, a photo of that attraction will be grabbed from the Flickr API and displayed
